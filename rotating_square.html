     * let step = 1 / Math.abs(m) (below)
     * 
     * As m increases, the generated segment will be longer, so the larger m grows, 
     * the smaller the step with which I generate the x must be, otherwise we would have 
     * empty spaces between one point and another on the line. ques
     * 
     * To understand why using 1/|m| as a step during the creation of the line is important, 
     * let's consider the following situation:
     *
     * Imagine having a line with a very high slope, for example m = 10, and two points A and B:
     * - A(0, 0)
     * - B(1, 10)
     *
     * If we use a fixed step of 1 for x, we will get the following points on the line:
     * - x = 0, y = 0
     * - x = 1, y = 10
     *
     * However, between these two points, we will have a series of x positions that do not 
     * correspond to integer values. For example, if we consider x = 0.1, we get:
     * - x = 0.1, y = 1
     * And if we consider x = 0.2, we get:
     * - x = 0.2, y = 2
     *
     * Continuing this way, we see that many integer values of y are missed because we are 
     * advancing with steps of 1 on x, and the line has a very steep slope.
     *
     * If, on the other hand, we use a step of 1/|m| (in our example, 1/10), we get a higher 
     * density of points because we are considering smaller steps on x to capture finer details 
     * along the line. This helps to reduce the loss of points when the slope is high, improving 
     * the representation of the line on a discrete grid.
     * 
     * However, suing 1/|m| can lead to very large step when m is very samll, this can cause the loss of point as wellwe so we set a maximum 
     * limit of 1 for the step. This ensures that even for shallow slopes, the step remains within a 
     * reasonable range to maintain a visually coherent representation of the line.
